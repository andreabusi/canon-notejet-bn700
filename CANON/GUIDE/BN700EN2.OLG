You can turn off the computer in the following manners:

* Press and hold the power switch until two short beeps sound (approximately for 2 to 4 seconds). After the power lamp blinks in orange, release the switch.  The computer turns off.

* Exit Windows.
Select Shut Down from the Windows "Start" button.  When the "Shut Down Windows" window appears, select "Shut down the computer?" and click Yes.  After a while, the computer turns off automatically.  

Make sure both the HDD and the FDD lamps are off when you turn the power off.

The power lamp turns off.

\bNote\b Do not turn the computer off while the Power-On Self-Test (POST) operates, otherwise the contents of CMOS may be damaged.
For details on the POST, refer to the |POST Errors setting|POST Errors| in the ROM-Resident Setup Utility.

{2_060een.gif}

\bWait for at least 15 seconds after turning the computer off before moving it.\b

The internal hard disk may not finish spinning for a few moments after the computer turns off. Moving the computer while the hard disk drive is still operating may damage the hard disk drive.

When you turn the main power off, the print head is automatically covered to prevent ink from drying out in the nozzle tip.  If you move the computer immediately after turning the power off, the cap may not cover the print head yet.  Wait for until the power lamp goes off (approximately 15 seconds) after turning the computer off.

{2_065een.gif}

\bThe computer caps the print head to preserve the ink supply when the power 
switch is turned off.\b

Your printer uses the Bubble Jet printing technology, which means that the printer operates by ejecting ink from the print head.  The capping function covers the print head to prevent ink from drying out in the nozzle tip.  The cap automatically covers the print head in the following cases:

* Approximately 15 seconds after printing is complete

* When the computer goes into the Suspended Mode

Using Floppy Disks
6
{2_125een.gif}

\bThe computer uses two different types of 3.5-inch floppy disks.\b

The basic difference between the two types of floppy disks is the amount of storage.

{2_130een.hsp}
{2_130een.gif}

\bThe computer uses 3.5-inch 2HD (double-sided, high-density) floppy disks.\b

This type of floppy disk holds up to 1.44 Mbytes of data.  This amount of storage is twice that of the 2DD type.

The 2HD disks have a small hole on the lower right-hand corner of the disk cover.  It may also have the initials HD on it.

{2_135een.gif}

\bThe computer also uses 3.5-inch 2DD (double-sided, double-density) floppy disks.\b

This type holds up to 720 Kbytes of data.  The disks do not have a hole on the lower right-hand corner of the disk cover.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Initializing Disks]
Using Floppy Disks
5

\bYou must initialize a floppy disk before you use it.\b

In order to read and write data to and from a floppy disk, the computer must first decide a method for writing the data, divide the floppy disk into address regions and create a place to record and control what data is written at which address on the disks.  This operation is called formatting or initializing.

Since different types of computers use different methods for writing on disks, formatting is necessary after purchasing new floppy disks.

The formatting process creates a new method of recording for your disk and erases all the previous information on the disk.  Before you format a disk, please check that any data can be deleted.

For more information on formatting, refer to the \i"Introducing Microsoft Windows 95"\i.

The data on floppy disks is written with magnetic fields.  Improper handling may damage or lose the precious data.  Observe the following precautions when you use the floppy disks:

{2_140een.gif}

\bNever place the disk near a magnetic field.\b

Never place the floppy disks near magnets, television sets, speakers and the other sources of magnetic fields.  Magnetic fields may damage or even erase the data on the floppy disks.

{2_145een.gif}

\bAvoid high temperatures and direct sunlight.\b

Do not expose the floppy disks to high temperatures or excessive humidity.  Also do not place them in direct sunlight.  Be sure to keep them within the range between 32 °F and 127 °F  (0 °C to 53 °C).

{2_150een.hsp}
{2_150een.gif}

\bNever touch the disk surface or hub of the floppy disk.\b

When you open the floppy disk shutter, a magnetic recording surface is visible.  Do not touch this surface with your fingers or expose it to dust.  The disk may become unusable.  Touching the floppy disk hub may also cause disk failure.

{2_155een.gif}

\bDo not mistreat floppy disks.\b

Do not drop the floppy disks or place heavy objects on the top of them.  Also avoid bending floppy disks and mistreating them in general.  Get into the habit of placing the disks in a protective plastic case and store the disks straight up when not in use.

{2_160een.gif}

\bNever use floppy disks that have liquids, eraser crumbs or other dirt on them.\b

Using the disks that have foreign substances may damage the floppy disks.  Never use the disks in this condition.

{2_125een.gif}

\bMake backup disks storing valuable data.\b

No floppy disks can be guaranteed against failure.  It is a good idea to store a copy of your valuable data on backup floppy disks as well as the original floppy disks.

Backup means making a copy of the original file in case the disk is damaged or unusable.

[Write-Protection]
Using Floppy Disks

{2_165een.hsp}
{2_165een.gif}

\bWhat is write-protection?\b

Floppy disks have a write-protect tab on its back to prevent data from accidental erasure.
You cannot change the data on a write-protected floppy disk in any way.  If the disk is write-protected, you cannot:

* Delete or change the current data

* Save new data on the disk

* Initialize the disk

New floppy disks are write-enabled so you can initialize and write data to the disk.  Switch the floppy disk between write-protected and write-enabled by switching the write-protect tab.

{2_170een.gif}

\bTo write-protect a floppy disk...\b

Move the write-protect tab down as illustrated, leaving the slot open.

The disk is now write-protected.

{2_175een.gif}

\bTo write-enable a disk...\b

Move the write-protect tab up as illustrated, covering the slot.

The disk is now write-enabled.

{2_180een.gif}

\bTo insert a floppy disk...\b

As shown in the illustration, gently push the floppy disk into the floppy disk drive with a label side up.  The floppy disk eject button pops out at this time.

{2_185een.gif}

\bTo remove a floppy disk...\b

Make sure that the FDD lamp is off, then press the floppy disk eject button.  The floppy disk pops out.

\bNote\b If the FDD lamp is on, the computer is still accessing the floppy disk.  Ejecting the disk during the access may damage the data on the disk or even destroy the floppy disk.

{3_005een.gif}

\bBefore you start printing...\b

Replace (or install) the cartridge if necessary.

Insert paper and position it properly.  For more details on positioning the paper, see |Inserting Regular Paper|Inserting Regular Paper| in this guide.

Run the printer test if necessary.

Start printing.

\bNote\b 
When using the computer powered by the battery pack, do not activate the printing operation while the power lamp blinks in red.  If you do, the built-in printer stops operating and the data in the printer's buffer memory will be lost.  Connect the AC adapter or replace the battery pack, and try again.

{3_010een.gif}

\bTo open the printer cover...\b

Open the printer cover if you need to replace the cartridge or check the paper feed.

Place your finger in the groove of the printer cover and raise it.

{3_015een.gif}

\bTo close the printer cover...\b

Gently close the printer cover until it clicks shut.

Be careful not to touch the internal parts of the printer and printer carriage.  When you open the printer cover, you see the internal parts such as the printer carriage and flexible cables.  Touching these parts or moving the printer carriage may cause serious damage to the printer.

{3_200een.gif}

\bAuto Sheet Feed and Manual Feed\b

The solid ASF lamp indicates that you can feed paper automatically.

To feed the paper manually, press the Stop/ASF switch for more than 1 second.
Release the switch when you hear a short beep.  The ASF lamp goes off at this time.  Insert the paper while the ASF lamp is off.
However, please do not insert the paper if the print head is still operating.

The ASF lamp automatically comes back on each time you finish printing a sheet to return to the auto sheet feed setting.  Therefore, when you want to make a few printouts by the manual feed function, you need to turn the ASF lamp off every time you finish printing a sheet of paper.
Follow the abovementioned procedure.

When you insert the paper, a short beep sounds first and the feeder advances the paper in approximately 1 second.  The ASF lamp lights up at this time for the auto sheet feed setting.
Please keep in mind that the system automatically returns to the auto sheet feed setting unless you insert paper for approximately 1 minute in the manual feed setting.

\bNotes on the Auto Sheet Feed\b

* Set the paper properly before printing.  This prevents the paper from feeding improperly.

* Remove the paper after the printing operation is finished.  This prevents the paper from rounding out accidentally.

* Do not touch the paper during the printing operation.  A few paper may advance at one time, or slant printouts may come out.

* Always be sure to use the same type of paper of the same size.

* Fix if the paper is bent.

* Use the manual feed function if the auto sheet feed function does not work due to the paper type used.

* Keep a flat space at the back of the machine.  If there are connecting cables behind, for example, the ejected paper may get trapped in the cables, causing dirt and accidental creases on the paper.

\bUse these types of paper:\b

	Regular good quality paper

	Letter-size or A4-size  paper

	Paper up to a maximum size of 8.5 x 14 inches (215.9 mm x 355.6 mm)

	Paper down to a minimum size of 7.2 x 7.2 inches (182 mm x 182 mm)

\bDo not use these types of paper:\b

Avoid using the following types of paper.  Otherwise, the print quality may not be satisfactory and even cause a paper jam.

	Folded or crumpled paper

	Hole-punched paper

	Wet or moist paper

	Continuous-fold paper 
	(paper with small round guide holes on either side, and perforations between pages).

\bUse of OHP transparency with BJ printers.\b

Do not use transparencies designed for plain paper copiers.  They do not absorb ink so they may stain the feed rollers and sometimes stain your fingers.  For information on usable types of OHP transparencies, see |Printer Supplies|Printer supplies|.

Do not keep OHP transparencies in high humidity and temperature.

Use of the Canon Transparencies CF-102 (A4 or letter-size) is recommended.

\bAfter printing on OHP transparencies, always clean the printer roller.\b

When you print on OHP transparencies, some of the ink is transferred to the feed rollers.  Clean the rollers immediately after printing is finished.

\bCautions about Envelope\b

You can use these two types with the printer.
	US Commercial 10: 241x105 mm (9.5 x 4.13 inches)
	European DL-size: 220x110 mm

Do not use the following types:
	Envelopes with windows, holes, perforations, cutouts and double flaps
	Envelopes made of special coated paper and deep embossed paper
	Envelopes with peel-off strips
	Envelopes which has already been used 

\bYou can also print on the Fabric Sheet.\b

With the Fabric Sheet Kit, you can print your original pictures and photographs on texture.
Please refer to the \iFabric Sheet Kit User's Manual\i.

\bNotes\b
* The Colorfast Packets are not necessary when printing with the built-in printer.

Insert paper.

Insert a sheet of paper.  If you have not put paper yet, read |Inserting Regular Paper|Inserting Regular Paper|.

{3_175een.gif}

In the application program, choose Print.

In the application program, choose the printer and document style, then start printing.

For more information on how to select Print, refer to the manual of your application program.

To stop printing in the middle of a job...

If you want to stop printing in the middle, press the Stop/ASF switch once to interrupt printing.

To restart an interrupted print job, press the Stop/ASF switch again to resume printing.

To cancel printing in the middle, enter a command to the application program or select cancel (For more information on how to cancel printing jobs, refer to the manual of your application program).

To delete unprinted data remaining in the printer's buffer, press the Stop/ASF switch and the Feed switch simultaneously until you hear three beep sounds.

If no paper is set, insert paper, then press the Feed switch. 
If a paper jam should occur, remove the paper first.  Insert new paper and press the Feed switch.

{3_190een.gif}

If you run out of paper while printing...

If you run out of paper while printing, the application program displays a message with instructions on how to proceed.

A beep sounds and the Error/Stop lamp blinks.  Insert additional paper, press the Feed switch to get rid of the printer error modes and enter a command to the application program to resume printing.

If the printer printed characters or graphics look scratchy, clean the print head.

You can print out all characters, symbols and graphics as they appear on the screen.  This type of print is called a hardcopy.

When running an application program from Windows:

1.	Insert paper.
2.	Press the "Print Screen" key.  This pastes the contents of the screen onto the clipboard.
3.	Paste the data from the clipboard into the application program.
4.	Select Print in the application program.

Using the Printer

\bCompatibility Differences\b

The built-in printer controller emulates the Canon BJ and the EPSON LQ.  However, some operations and functions are not compatible because of hardware differences such as the printing mechanism and the print head structure.  Read this part carefully if you need to make common printer driver programs for the BJ or LQ.

\bNote\b Due to hardware differences, the reverse feed code (ESC ]) is not supported by the built-in printer.

\bNote\b Due to hardware differences, the justification code (ESC a) and the reverse page feed code (ESC j) are not supported by the built-in printer.

This lists the control codes and ESCape sequences you can use in the BJ Emulation and LQ Emulation.  For more details about these programming commands, contact a Canon service facility.  See |Support Center List|Support Center List| for your reference.

The control codes and ESCape sequences indicate the printer how to print a job.  You can send commands to the printer in one of the two ways:

You can use your application software to automatically embed certain commands (such as bold, underline or indent) within a document.  When the document prints, the embedded commands control the way the printer produces the printed page.  Refer to your application software manual for instructions on sending commands.

You can send specific commands directly to the printer, using either a BASIC programming statement or a printer command option in your software.

In the BJ emulation, your printer supports 10 IBM code pages: USA code page 437, Multilingual code page 850, Arabic code page 864, Canadian French code page 863, Cyrillic (Russian) code page 855, Greek code page 869, Norwegian code page 865, Portuguese code page 860, Slavic (Latin II) code page 852 and Turkish code page 857.  The USA and Multilingual code pages have three character sets: Character Set 1, Character Set 2 and All-characters Chart.

To select the code page, use the Built-in Printer Setup Utility.  If you want to run the Built-in Printer Setup Utility now click |here|!run c:\canon\util\cwprnset.exe|.

Each code page corresponds to the All-characters Chart.  With the All-characters Chart, there are no control codes except the space code at ASCII 32.  All the other ASCII characters are printable.  The All-characters Chart is selected by the ESC ^ or the ESC \\ code.

The Character Set 1 has control codes in two places: one between ASCII 0 and ASCII 32, and the other between ASCII 128 and ASCII 159.  The Character Set 2 has control codes between ASCII 0 and 32.  All the other ASCII characters are printable.

To see these character sets, select the appropriate topic below.  To exit the character set screen when you finish viewing the characters, simply close the window.

\bLQ emulation\b

In the LQ emulation, two character sets are defined: the italics set and the graphics set.  However, a portion of each of these sets is governed by a country setting, allowing it to print special characters used in particular countries.  These special characters, as a group, are called the international characters.

Use the Built-in Printer Setup Utility to select the LQ emulation character set.  Choose the italics and graphics character sets from the Built-in Printer Setup Utility as well as the country setting for international characters.  If you want to run the Built-in Printer Setup Utility now click |here|!run c:\canon\util\cwprnset.exe|.

In the LQ emulation, your printer can access the following character sets:

	|Epson Italics|!img 3_295een.gif|
	|Epson Graphics|!img 3_300een.gif|
	|Epson International|!img 3_305een.gif|

By clicking one of these topics, you can see these character sets.  To exit the screen with the character sets, simply close the window.

The Italics character set has control codes in two places: one between the ASCII 0 and ASCII 32, and the other between ASCII 128 and ASCII 159.  In addition, the Italics character set has the italics characters between ASCII A0 and ASCII FF.  All the other characters are printable.  The characters from ASCII 80 to ASCII FF correspond to IBM Character Set 2.

International Character Sets
By selecting an International Character Set with Built-in Printer Setup Utility, you can print characters and symbols of eight different countries' languages: U.S.A., U.K., Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, and Spain.

When you want to print other languages, select the appropriate code page.  The printer supports 10 code pages.  See |BJ emulation|BJ emulation|.

\bNote\b
When you select a code page to print characters and symbols of your language, be sure to select the Graphics character table.  Otherwise, the characters and symbols between ASCII 128 and ASCII 255 are changed to italic characters.

If the print looks scratchy or faint, clean the print head.  Cleaning the print head cleans the nozzles and modulates the ink from the nozzles to improve print quality. 

Clean the print head only when print quality is poor.  Unnecessary cleaning of the print head uses up the ink supply.  You can clean the print head automatically by running the print head cleaning program of the computer.  The built-in cleaning program runs from Windows.

There are two types of print head cleaning:

* Quick Cleaning
Use this function to improve print quality.  It takes approximately 30 seconds.

* Long Head Cleaning
Use this function to solve severe clogging problems.  It takes approximately 60 seconds.

\bNote\b 
The long head cleaning use more ink than the quick cleaning.  Perform only when the print quality does not recover after repeating the quick cleaning.

To clean the print head, take the following steps:

1. Make sure that printing operation from the application program to the built-in printer has been finished.

2. Double-click the Built-in Printer icon in the Canon folder.

3. Click Cleaning to open the "Cleaning" window.

4. Choose Quick Cleaning or Long Head Cleaning.
Click OK to begin cleaning.  After cleaning begins, you cannot stop the process.  When the cleaning is finished, click Cancel to close the "Cleaning" window.

5. Print the nozzle check pattern.  Insert letter-size or A4-size paper into the paper feed slot.  Click Test Print to open the "Test Print" window.  Then, select Nozzle and click OK.

6. Close the "Test Print" window.

7. Close the "Built-in Printer Setup" window.

To run this program from Windows without exiting this On-line Guide, select |running the print head cleaning program|!run c:\canon\util\cwprnset.exe|.

You can also clean the print head with the Cartridge Instructions Utility.  See Help of the Cartridge Instructions Utility for details.

If the check pattern does not print clearly, repeat the head cleaning procedure.

However, if the printing quality does not improve after cleanings, you need to replace the ink cartridge.

If the print quality still does not improve, replace the BJ cartridge.

\bNiMH Battery Pack\b

With the AC adapter disconnected, the battery pack supplies power with the computer. 
The computer comes with the NiMH battery pack.

Before operating the computer for the first time, we recommend that you discharge the battery pack first, then charge the battery pack by using the "Refreshing battery" function in the Operating Environment Utility.  It takes about 15 hours to finish this "refresh" procedure in the Suspended mode.
See |Refreshing the Battery Pack|Refreshing the Battery Pack|.

Your battery pack has an operating lifetime of approximately 300 charges and discharges.

\bRemaining power in the battery pack\b

The color of the power lamp indicates how much power remains in the battery pack.

We suggest that you save the data when the power lamp blinks in red.  It indicates it is time to recharge the battery pack.

{5_015een.gif}

\bIf you want to continue working, use the 
AC adapter.\b

If you want to continue your work when the power lamp blinks in red, connect the AC adapter to the computer.  You can continue the work and the battery pack will be recharged.

\b\mImportant\b\k To avoid possible short circuit, be very careful that you do not make the metal part(s) of the AC adapter touch other metal object(s) such as the printer connector.  If short circuit should occur, the AC adapter protection circuit activates automatically to halt the AC adapter's function temporarily.  If this happens, remove the power cable from the AC power outlet, wait for more than 5 minutes, then try again.

{5_010een.hsp}
{5_010een.gif}

\bPower continues to drop...\b

When the power lamp blinks in red, the battery pack has almost no power.  The system automatically stores data into the hard disk while you continue your work, then the computer enters the Suspended mode.
Also the built-in printer/scanner stops its operation while the power lamp blinks in red.  The data in the buffer memory is lost.

If the power lamp blinks in red, charge your battery pack at once or replace the battery pack with a fully charged one.

Do not activate the printing or scanning operation while the power lamp blinks in red.  If you have already started the printing or scanning, connect the AC adapter or replace the battery pack and try again.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Battery Life]
Charging the Battery Pack
5

The NiMH battery pack lasts for about 2 to 2.5 hours under normal use.
It takes about 150 minutes (maximum) to charge the battery pack (to the full charge condition after connecting the AC adapter) when the computer is in use. 
When the computer is either off or in the Suspended mode, it takes about 60 minutes.

The charge time may vary according to the temperature and the condition of the battery pack even under the same operating conditions.  The time shown above is a guideline.

\bNotes\b
* When the SCSI-2 compatible device is connected to the computer, the operating time of the battery varies according to the device in use.  
* When you print from the built-in printer powered by the battery, the operating time of the battery varies according to the number of the printouts or the emulation settings.  

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Suspended Mode]
Charging the Battery Pack
5

When the system enters the Suspended mode, the screen display goes off.  The previous screen and the memory contents are saved into the hard disk at this time.
In this event, the Suspend condition is virtually the same as the condition when the power has turns off. 

To enter the Suspended mode, press and hold the power switch until one short beep sounds (approximately within 2 second).
After the power lamp blinks in green, release the switch.
Or, select Suspend from the Windows "Start" button.  The computer enters the Suspended mode automatically.

The system will be suspended.  The system displays "Save to disk in progress.  Please wait...".

\bNote\b The Suspend function set by the power switch can be disabled by the Power switch for Suspend setting in the ROM-Resident Setup Utility.
If the Suspend function is disabled, the system does not enter the Suspended Mode when you press the power switch for 2 seconds or shorter.
For details about the Power switch for Suspend setting, see |ROM-Resident Setup Utility|ROM:Power switch for Suspend|.
Please also note that you can determine the specified time after which the system is suspended by the Operating Environment Utility or ROM-Resident Setup Utility.

To exit the computer from the Suspended mode, press the power switch again.
The system displays "Resume from disk in progress.  Please wait...".
To turn off the computer, press and hold the power switch until two short beeps sound (approximately for 2 to 4 seconds).  After the power lamp blinks in orange, release the switch.
If you keep pressing the power switch for more than 4 seconds, the switch operation will be invalid (The power lamp remains green and nothing changes).  If the operations of suspend and power-off are mistaken, the computer returns to the original status if you press the power switch for a long time.
For more information, see |Turning the Computer On and Off|Turning the Computer On and Off|.

When you use the computer to create data without the AC adapter, you should get into the habit of saving data frequently.  Always make sure you save the data before you interrupt your work or leave the computer for a few moments.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Memory Effect]
Charging the Battery Pack
5

If you repeatedly charge the battery pack after little energy is used, its maximum charge capacity gradually becomes smaller.  This is called the "memory effect", which reduces the lifetime of the battery.

The memory effect could occur in the following occasions:

You have been working outside and used the battery little.  
Then you come back inside, connect the AC adapter and start working again.

If the AC adapter is connected when the power lamp is green or orange, the Charge lamp lights up and the battery is charged.  This is the same as using little energy, then charging it little.

To avoid the memory effect, follow the next precautions when using the battery:

* Start charging only after the power lamp starts blinking in red.  Do not charge the battery when the power lamp is green or orange.

* When the power is supplied by the battery pack, use the battery pack until the power lamp blinks in red.  Do not connect the AC adapter until the power lamp starts blinking in red.

If the memory effect occurs, you can restore the battery to its original capacity by discharging the remaining energy completely, then charge the battery fully.
In order to minimize the "memory effect", keep the following instructions:
1. Be sure to charge the battery after the power lamp blinks in red.
2. Refresh the battery every 10 times.

[How to Charge the Battery]
Charging the Battery Pack
15
{5_020een.gif}

When the power lamp blinks in red...

We suggest that you save the data when the power lamp blinks in red.

{5_025een.gif}

Connect the AC adapter to the computer.

Connect the AC adapter to the back of the computer, then to the power cable.

You can charge the battery at any time if the AC adapter is available.
It takes about 150 minutes (maximum) to charge the battery pack when the computer is in use.  When the computer is either off or in the Suspended mode, it takes about 60 minutes.

\bWarning\b When charging the battery pack, be sure to follow the instructions, 
using the exclusive charger.  The manufacturer and its subsidiaries will assume no responsibility for any malfunction, damage or accident resulting from use of any other charger.

\b\mImportant\b\k To avoid possible short circuit, be very careful that you do not make the metal part(s) of the AC adapter touch other metal object(s) such as the printer connector.  If short circuit should occur, the AC adapter protection circuit activates automatically to halt the AC adapter's function temporarily.  If this happens, remove the power cable from the AC power outlet, wait for more than 5 minutes, then try again.

{5_030een.gif}

Plug the power cable into an AC power outlet.

The type of plug differs from country to country.

{5_035een.gif}

When the Charge lamp turns on, charging starts.

While the battery pack is charged, the Charge lamp lights up.
Normally, you can charge the battery pack while operating the computer.  To charge the battery pack faster, we recommend you to turn the computer off or set the computer to the Suspended mode.
The Charge lamp blinks when the unit is waiting to be charged (waiting for the correct temperature).
If the computer indicates an error, disconnect the AC adapter or the battery pack.
When charging is complete, the Charge lamp turns off.  Since charging stops automatically when the battery is fully charged, it is always possible to keep the AC adapter connected.
It takes about 60 minutes to charge the battery pack completely in either the off position or the Suspended mode.

If a problem occurs during charging, the Charge lamp and the power lamp will blink by turns.  See |Panel Lamp Messages|Panel Lamp Messages|.

Be careful when disposing of the battery pack.

Never dispose of the battery pack by incineration, or try to disassemble and reconstruct it.  Be sure to observe all local regulations regarding the locations and methods of disposing of the batteries.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Conserving Battery Power]
Computer Power
5

The battery pack lasts for a long period of time if you use the power properly.  The computer has the power-saving function; if no operations occur within a certain period of time, the power-saving function works automatically.

You can set a period of time before the computer goes into the power-saving mode by using the Utilities.  For a description of the Power Saving Mode and setting instructions, see |Utilities|Utilities|.

The battery pack loses a little energy even when the computer is off.  Remove the battery pack if you do not use the computer for a long time.

The battery pack discharges even when you remove it from the computer.  This discharge occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures, so keep the battery pack in a cool location when not in use.  The battery pack stored for a long time, even if it was fully charged initially, has already lost a little power.  When the battery pack has not been used for a long time, we recommend that you discharge the battery pack first, then charge the battery pack by using the "Refreshing battery" function in the Operating Environment Utility.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[In Case of Power Failure]
Computer Power
5

If central power failure occurs while you are using the AC adapter, the battery pack automatically powers the computer.  Use the computer following the guidelines about the use of the battery pack.

When the power failure is over, the AC adapter starts to power the computer automatically.

If the battery capacity is exhausted, there is a possibility that the power failure may cause you to lose power or data stored in the computer memory while you are using the AC adapter.

If the power failure occurs when the battery capacity is exhausted, follow the next procedure:

1. Save the data (if necessary).
2. Turn the computer off.  Press and hold the power switch until two short beeps sound (approximately for 2 to 4 seconds).  After the power lamp blinks in orange, release the switch.
3. Disconnect the AC adapter from an AC power outlet.
4. Wait until the power failure is over and the central power is restored. 
5. Reconnect the AC adapter and press the power switch (This avoids a power surge that may damage the computer).
6. When the power is restored, check the following:
	* Does the system display the initial screen correctly?
	* Does the system retain the data stored on the disks?

Be aware of the possibility of losing data stored in memory.  You should get into the habit of saving the data frequently.  In particular, always make sure that you save the data before you interrupt your work or leave the computer for a few moments.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Extreme Conditions]
Computer Power
5

Be aware of the following cautions when using the battery pack in cold conditions.

When the battery pack has been chilled and then brought into a warm room to be charged, it may stop charging even though it does not reach the full capacity yet.  This is typically characteristic of the NiMH battery.

If the battery pack is colder than the room temperature, keep it in the room until it reaches the room temperature before charging.
With the NiMH battery, the ambient chargeable temperature range is between 41° F to 95° F (5° C to 35° C).

\bMake the Install Disks first, using the Microsoft Create System Disks program and the System Backup Utility.\b
For reinstallation of the operating systems, you need to make the Install Disks first by using the Microsoft Create System Disk Program and the System Backup Utility as the computer suggests initially on the display.  These disks return the computer to the original system configuration.

\bWhen you need to reinstall the operating system:\b
Normally, when you turn on the power switch, the Windows operating systems start up automatically.  If the operating system will not start up, you may need to reinstall it.  The following are possible situations for reinstalling the operating system:
	a) When you want to return the computer system to the Windows 95 commercially available
	b) When the computer (hardware) has stopped working for some reason
	c) When certain programs (software) have stopped for some reason

\bCheck that the "Suspend" area is correct.\b
Before you formatting the hard disk, check that the "Suspend" area is correct.  Use the PHDISK.EXE program to check the information about the "Suspend" area.  This program is available in the hard disk (c:\\canon\\others) and in the floppy disk labeled "System Utility Setup Disk" created by the System Backup Utility.  The information about the "Suspend" area appears when you type the following word at the MS-DOS prompt:
	phdisk /info Enter
We suggest you re-create this area if it has been destroyed.  For more information about the PHDISK.EXE program, refer to the PHDISK.WRI file in the same directory as the PHDISK.EXE program.

\bCopy the Install Disks onto the hard disk.\b
To install the operating system and system utility programs, copy all the contents of the Install Disks you have backed up onto the hard disk.  The contents of the Installation Disks are:

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Battery Problems]
If a Problem Occurs
5

\b\mThe fully charged battery pack is discharged too soon.\b\k
Discharge the battery pack first, then charge the battery pack by using the "Refreshing battery" function in the Operating Environment Utility.  It takes about 15 hours to finish this "refresh" procedure in the Suspended mode.
If you still have the problem, change the battery pack.  If you still cannot solve the problem, contact a Canon service facility.

\b\mThe Charge lamp is blinking fast.\b\k
It is not possible to charge the battery.  Remove the AC adapter, wait until the temperature of the battery returns to the room temperature and start charging the battery again.  If the Charge lamp still blinks, there may be a failure in the battery.  Be sure to remove the battery you are using and connect the AC adapter or a new battery. 
If you cannot solve the problem, however, contact a Canon service facility.

\b\mThe battery pack cannot be charged though no remaining battery power is available.\b\k
Check the following:
- Remove the power cable from the AC power outlet, wait for more than 5 minutes, then try again.
- The data inside the battery pack may be damaged since the computer has not been used long (e.g. for six months to one year).  The data is destroyed inside if the battery icon does not come with a gauge in the "Current operating mode" of the Operating Environment Utility.  The battery pack is still usable.  However, we strongly recommend that you replace the battery pack with a new one as soon as possible for correct operation.

\b\mThe power lamp and the Charge lamp blink by turns.\b\k
Two reasons are possible:
1. The charging error has occurred.
2. Either the battery or the system may be out of order.
Check the following:
- Check that the AC adapter is connected properly.
- Remove the AC adapter or the battery pack, then reinstall it and recharge the battery.
- Discharge the battery pack first, then charge the battery pack by using the "Refreshing battery" function in the Operating Environment Utility.
If you still have the problem, change the battery pack.  If you still cannot solve the problem, contact a Canon service facility.

\b\mThe battery pack is not charged though the computer is set to the off position or in the Suspended mode.\b\k
The AC adapter protection circuit may be active now.  Remove the power cable from the AC power outlet, wait for more than 5 minutes, then try again.
If you still cannot solve the problem, contact a Canon service facility.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Sound Problems]
If a Problem Occurs
5

\b\mNo sounds are heard.\b\k
- Adjust the speaker volume.  Keep pressing Fn and F3 keys.
- Check that nothing is connected to the headset jack.

If you still cannot solve the problem, contact a Canon service facility.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Printer Problems (I)]
If a Problem Occurs
5

\b\mThe printer does not operate: the power lamp is red and blinking.\b\k
When using the computer powered by the battery pack, do not activate the printing operation while the power lamp blinks in red.  If you do, the built-in printer stops operating and the data in the printer's buffer memory will be lost.  Connect the AC adapter or replace the battery pack, and try again.

\b\mThe printer does not operate: the Error/Stop lamp is blinking.\b\k
-Check that paper is set properly.
-Check that paper is installed with no jam.  If the paper is jammed, remove the paper.
-Check the BJ cartridge are installed correctly.
Press the Stop/ASF switch and the Feed switch simultaneously until you hear three beep sounds.  Then release the switches and reset the printer.  If no paper is set, insert paper, then press the Feed switch.  If a paper jam should occur, remove the paper first.  Insert new paper and press the Feed switch.

\b\mThe printer does not operate: the Error/Stop lamp is lit.\b\k
Press the Stop/ASF switch to make the printer usable.

\b\mThe printer does not operate: both the Error/Stop lamp and Data lamp are blinking by turns.\b\k
-Open the printer cover and make sure that no object or fragment of paper interrupts the function of the print head.  Press the Stop/ASF switch and the Feed switch simultaneously until you hear three beep sounds.  Then release the switches and reset the printer.  If you still have the problem, contact a Canon service facility.
-The wasted ink tank may be full.  Contact a Canon service facility.

\b\mWhen you turn the power switch on, the Error/Stop lamp and the Data lamp blink by
turns for approximately 3 seconds and the beep sounds.\b\k
This indicates the waste ink is almost full at the tank but the computer is still usable.  But contact a Canon service facility to change an element of the built-in printer unit as soon as possible.

\b\mThe printer does not print properly.\b\k
This could be:
-The emulation mode the printer is set to and the application you are using may have different printer settings.
-The Windows printer driver may not be correctly selected.
-The program may not be sending data correctly.
Check the following:
-Press the Stop/ASF switch and the Feed switch simultaneously until you hear three beep sounds.  Then release the switches and reset the printer.
-Verify the printer driver settings in your application program and in the Built-in Printer Setup Utility.  You can do this in the "Built-in Printer" of the Canon folder.  The emulation setting selection for your application program should look like this:

\b\uThe driver settings for each emulation selection\b\u
     -\bCanon MBJC-700 Lite driver or Canon MBJC-800 driver setting:\b BJ or LQ emulation
     -\bLQ-510driver setting:\b LQ emulation
     -\bLQ-2550driver setting:\b LQ emulation

\b\uPrinting with DOS Applications\b\u
When printing from software applications running under DOS, you have to install the printer driver with each application.

[The Printer Problems (II)]
If a Problem Occurs
5

\b\mThe paper does not advance.\b\k
Check the following:
-Be careful not to touch the paper before the printing operation.
-Check that you are using the same type of paper of the same size.
-Check that the paper is not bent.
-If the paper is inserted improperly, eject the paper once and insert again.
-Check the thickness of the paper.  Use the manual feed function if the auto sheet feed function does not work due to the paper type used.
-Check that the number of paper you have set.  You can set up to 10 sheets (maximum 1 mm/0.039" with normal plain paper).  Note that the number of sheets you can set depends on the thickness of the paper you use.
-Check that the paper guide is not set too tight.

\b\mThe feeder advances a few paper at one time.\b\k
-Check that the paper is not adherent to each other for some reason (static electricity for example).
-Check that the number of paper you have set.  You can set up to 10 sheets (maximum 1 mm/0.039" with normal plain paper).  Note that the number of sheets you can set depends on the thickness of the paper you use.
-Check the thickness of the paper.  Use the manual feed function if the auto sheet feed function does not work due to the paper type used.
-Check that the paper is not bent.
-Be careful not to touch the paper before the printing operation.
-Check that you are using the same type of paper of the same size.

\b\mThe feeder does not advance an envelope properly.\b\k
-Check that the paper is not bent.
-Check that the folder of the envelope is set in the printer neatly.
Follow the next instructions if the envelope will not advance even in the vertical direction.
In the manual feed setting, a short beep sounds first and the feeder advances the envelope in approximately 1 second.  Push the envelope in lightly at this time.
If this still does not work, it may be a good idea to make the top of the envelope completely flat using a tip of a pen, for instance.

\b\mThe printer stops in the middle of the printing operation.\b\k
-Does the print head sometimes stop in the middle of the printing operation?
To avoid excessive heat build-up, the print head stops before turning to the reverse direction (You can continue the printing operation).  However, stop the operation at your earliest convenience and turn the computer off for a while to take the heat out of the print head.

\b\mPaper is not ejected after printing.\b\k
-Does the same operation occur when you print other documents?
Some application programs do not eject the printed paper after the printing operation.
Keep pressing the Feed switch until the paper ejection starts.
-Is the Data lamp flashing on and off?
If the paper is not ejected and the Data lamp is blinking after the printing operation, unprinted data still remains in the printer.  Keep pressing the Feed switch until the paper ejection starts.

\b\mThe paper gets dirty with errant ink.\b\k
Feed in two or three blank pages through the printer.

\b\mThe printer does not print clearly or dots are missed out when printing.\b\k
Check or do the following:
-The detailed emulation settings in the "Built-in Printer" of the Canon folder are correct.
-Clean the print head.
-Run a printer test.
-If the printer still does not print clearly, replace the ink cartridge.  Follow the "Cartridge Instructions" program to replace the ink cartridge.
-If the printer still does not print clearly, replace the BJ cartridge.  Follow the "Cartridge Instructions" program to replace the BJ cartridge.

\b\mThe print is too light.\b\k
See above; the printer does not print clearly or dots are missed out.

\b\mThe print is scratchy.\b\k
See above; the printer does not print clearly or dots are missed out.

\b\mThe print is blurry.\b\k
-Choose "Fine" in the Print Density from the Built-in Printer Setup Utility.
-You may be printing on the reverse side of the paper.  Turn the paper over and try again.
-You may be using the wrong type of paper for the printer.  Check the paper type in use.

\b\mYou cannot remove the cartridge.\b\k
If you cannot remove the cartridge when using the "Cartridge Instructions" program, contact a Canon service facility.

\b\mThere are white lines in the print.\b\k
See above; the printer does not print clearly or dots are missed out.

\b\mThere are black lines in the print.\b\k
If black lines appear when you print graphic data with halftones, use the Built-in Printer Setup Utility to set the Graphic Mode to On.

\b\mA color draft results in a black and white printout.\b\k
-Check that the color BJ cartridge is installed.

\bThe lamp is off:\b 
- No power is supplied to the computer.  The AC adapter or the battery is not connected.
- The battery error has occurred in the following situation:
  * when the battery is used as the current power source
  * when the battery is charged while the computer is off
  * when the battery is charged while the computer is in the Suspended mode
Discharge the battery pack first, then charge the battery pack by using the "Refreshing battery" function in the Operating Environment Utility.  If this operation does not work, replace the battery.
If you still cannot solve the problem, contact a Canon service facility.
- The battery is not charged.  Charge the battery.
- The battery is charged (or not charged) while the computer is either off or in the Suspended mode.
During the battery charge operation, the power lamp lights up (or blinks) for approximately 2 seconds and goes off for approximately 18 seconds in sequence.  When the power lamp lights up (or blinks), it indicates the remaining power by its color.  See the following for details.  
No response is necessary.


\bThe lamp is green:\b  The battery is in use and it still has much power remaining (remaining power 100% to 80%).  Or the AC adapter has been connected.  No response is necessary.

\bThe lamp is orange:\b  The battery is in use but its power is starting to run low (remaining power 80% to 60%).  No response is necessary.

\bThe lamp is orange and blinking:\b  The battery is in use but its power is starting to run very low (remaining power 60% to 40%).  No response is necessary.

\bThe lamp is red:\b  The battery is in use but it has little power remaining (remaining power 40% to 20%).  No response is necessary.

\bThe lamp is red and blinking:\b  The battery is in use.  However, the battery has almost no power and it will be dead very soon (remaining power 20% to 0%).  It is recommended that you save the data at this point (The system automatically saves data into the hard disk while you continue your work, then the computer enters the Suspended mode).  Also the built-in printer/scanner stops its operation.  The data in the printer/scanner's buffer memory is lost.
If you continue your work, connect the AC adapter.  You can continue the work and the battery pack will be charged. If you continue the printing or scanning, try again after connecting the AC adapter or replacing the battery pack.  


\bThe lamp is green and blinking fast:\b  A malfunction has occurred in the system.  Contact a Canon service facility.

\bThe color of the lamp changes from green, orange, red, and off by turns:\b
This sequence indicates the battery power is discharged now.
It takes about 13 hours to discharge the battery from the full charge.
No response is necessary.

\bThe power lamp and the Charge lamp blink by turns:\b 
Two reasons are possible:
1. The charging error has occurred.
2. Either the battery or the system may be out of order.
Remove the AC adapter or the battery and suspend charging.  Charge the battery again.

When the power lamp and the Charge lamp keep blinking by turns, remove the battery you are using and connect the AC adapter or use a new battery.
